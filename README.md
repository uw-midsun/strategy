 - If your task is not currently on the JIRA, create and assign yourself a ticket, and put the ticket under the appropriate Epic
 - Move onto a new branch and call it what you're trying to address (e.g. dynamicsfixes)
 - Make your changes locally and commit them
 - In your commit message, lead off with the ticket you're addressing (i.e. "STRAT-31 Creating a tutorial")
 - Push the changes to an upstream branch
 - Open a PR and it will be reviewed
 - If your PR has not been reviewed within 24 hours, copy the link and paste it into the gen-strategy channel on Slack

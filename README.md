# Strategy
A repository of the models and race strategy developed for MSXIV (and beyond!)
## What's here
 - Expected Solar Energy
 - A model of the car's energy consumption
 - A model of motor efficiency
 - A battery efficiency model
 - A SOC model
 - Our optimization strategy

## Getting Started
- Make sure Python3 is installed on your system (open a command prompt and type `python3` or `py`, you should be brought to an interactive Python session). If it's not, download the latest release at [here](https://www.python.org/downloads/).
- Clone this repository by running `git clone https://github.com/uw-midsun/strategy.git`. This creates a local copy of code for you to make changes to.
- Navigate into the new folder with `cd strategy` and then run `pip3 install -r requirements` to download the python packages. If this doesn't work, try `py -3 -m pip install -r requirements.txt`.
- To make sure everything is up and working, run `pytest` from the command line. This should run a number of tests. If they all pass, you're all set to go!
- After making changes, be sure to run `pytest` before committing to make sure your changes haven't broken any tests. If they have, go fix them!
- If you've never used Git/GitHub before, read through [this tutorial](https://githowto.com/). All changes are made locally in a branch, committed, and pushed to the remote repository once completed. Then, go to [Github](https://github.com/uw-midsun/strategy/pulls) and open a new pull request ([PR](https://help.github.com/en/github/collaborating-with-issues-and-pull-requests/about-pull-requests)), which is requesting approval to merge the changes into the master branch. 
- Message Emma Wai on [Slack](https://uwmidsun.slack.com/) to say hello!

## How do I contribute?
 - Clone the repository (if you're unsure about this part, message Clarke VandenHoven on Slack)
 - Find a ticket on the JIRA board that sounds interesting (https://uwmidsun.atlassian.net/jira/software/projects/STRAT/boards/12)
 - If your task is not currently on the JIRA, create and assign yourself a ticket, and put the ticket under the appropriate Epic
 - Move onto a new branch and call it what you're trying to address (e.g. dynamicsfixes)
 - Make your changes locally and commit them
 - In your commit message, lead off with the ticket you're addressing (i.e. "STRAT-31 Creating a tutorial")
 - Push the changes to an upstream branch
 - Open a PR and it will be reviewed
 - If your PR has not been reviewed within 24 hours, copy the link and paste it into the gen-strategy channel on Slack

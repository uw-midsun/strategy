# Routemodel

A directory for modelling the routes the car will take, including information on elevations, navigations, and speedlimits.

### Data Retrieval Module

Connects and receives responses from Bing Maps APIs to form route / navigation and elevations profile.

+ `routes.py`: Methods to query Routes endpoint, collecting information on latitude, longitude, maneuver instructions, distance to maneuver, distance, and street

+ `speedlimits.py`: Methods to query Routes endpoint, collecting information around speed limit changes. Separate call from `routes.py` due to specific route points constraints
+ `common.py`: Common code to execute query on any of the above endpoints and catch errors
+ `config_example.py`: Sample API key file. To use, create a duplicate of this file callled `config.py` and fill in the `API_KEY` field

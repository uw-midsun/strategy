These are the plans to change the polynomial interpolation to a spline (linear) interpolation through a piece-wise function

Make a points method 
-   the points of two data sets in the data (SOC, OCV)

list [ (SOC, OCV),  (SOC, OCV), (SOC, OCV), (SOC, OCV), ...]

Piece_wise_class:
    def make linear_model(list):
        for points in list:
            x1 = points[0]
            y1 = points[1]
            x2
            y2
            m = y2 - y1 / x2 - x1

Figure out how to plot the points and the slope 
-   matplotlib 
-   numphy

Decide which where the implementation will be easier

# Dashboard

Directory for dashboard visualization. WORK IN PROGRESS. 

## Instructions for running
+ pip install `dash` and `dash-boostrap-components`. We will need to add this to requirements.txt as we develop it.
+ Run `index.py` file to start server. Should start on [local host at port 8050](http://localhost:8050/)

## Directory components
+ `/assets`: Holds CSS stylesheets and miscellaneous items.
+ `application.py`: Initializes app.
+ `index.py`: Combines tabs charge.py, route.py, and other.py. This is the launch file for local testing. 
+ `charge.py`, `route.py`, `other.py`: page-specific files
